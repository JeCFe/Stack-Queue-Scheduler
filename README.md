# Stack-Queue-scheduler
 
This was a submission made for my Secure System module at university. The goal of this assignment was to create a stack and priority queue with a scheduler to ensure that even low priority items were dealt with, even if higher priority items were still waiting to be processed.

Due to the nature of this code, it is reasonable to look at and study from the provide code, however it is prohibited to copy this work in any assignment / coursework
